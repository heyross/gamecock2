# Agent Notes

## Next Session
- Flesh out downloaders for additional datasets (equity and commodity swaps, EDGAR filing downloads).
- Expand SQLite schema to store parsed records from NCEN/NPORT and link with CIK/LEI mappings.
- Implement search functions across the stored swaps and filings to trace liability chains.
- Integrate local LLM summarization for free-form filings to extract derivative information.
